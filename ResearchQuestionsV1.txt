Performance evaluation of:

- Retrieval of units from Wikidata items (Pywikibot or SPARQL)
- Retrieval of units from Wikipedia articles (AnnoMathTeX or unsupervised)
- Generation of identifier values
- Consistency check of identifier units
- Solution assessment (value or unit wrong)
- Rearranging equations using CAS

For MathMLben Formula Concept testset check:
(mathmlben.wmflabs.org - GoldID 310-375)

- How many identifier items have unit properties? Which ones? (list the properties, discuss their strengths and weaknesses)
- Can the unit information be used to make a unit consistency check for left- and right-hand side of the formula?
- How to (semi-)automatically calculate/retrieve reasonable values for the identifiers?
- How many constants can be retrieved from Wikidata? Just values or units also?
- What are the issues in each step?
- How can they be adressed?
